NAME
    Class::Lego::Constructor - Automated constructor generation

SYNOPSIS
      use Class::Lego::Constructor; # exports defer and lazy
      BEGIN {
        @ISA = qw( Class::Lego::Constructor );
      }

      __PACKAGE__->mk_constructor0({
        magical_number   => 42,
        timestamp => defer { DateTime->new },
      });
      # the weird name, mk_constructor0, is on purpose while API settles

DESCRIPTION
      NOTE: That modules was formely Class::Constructor::Factory.
      It will enter the Class-Lego dist soon.

    I like the simplicity of Class::Accessor and friends. With them,
    creating accessors is a piece of cake. It does give me a default
    constructor as well.

    The case is that this default constructor is not as convenient as the
    generated accessors. To be precise, I want to specify default values for
    attributes easily. This module is a tentative solution to this problem.
